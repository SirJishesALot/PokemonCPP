# PokemonCPP
A text based Pokémon game I made using C++ <br>
Only works on Linux terminals at the moment cuz I used system commands. Yes I know, sue me.

## How to run the game
For people who already know their way around a unix based terminal, all you need to do is navigate to where the folder is installed on your computer. Go to the corresponding version folder and then enter `./pokemonGame` to run the game.
<br><br>
For those who don't know their way around a unix based terminal, do the following:
1. Find where the folder is located through a Finder window or your file explorer of choice. <br>
2. Right click on the version folder of choice and then click 'New Terminal at Folder'. <br>
3. Type `./pokemonGame` into the Terminal followed by the return key to run the game. <br>

**Note: Make sure your Terminal window is in fullscreen for the best experience.**

## Versions
